   - `predictions.ipynb`: Utilize this notebook for making predictions and running the trained model on new images or videos.

5. **Model Checkpoints:**
   - `best.pt`: This file contains the weights of the YOLOv8 model at the epoch where it achieved the best performance during training.
   - `last.pt`: Save time and continue training or fine-tuning the model from the point it left off using this file, which contains the weights from the last epoch.

6. **Roboflow Integration:** Easily create custom datasets for training by leveraging Roboflow. Use their platform to annotate images, manage datasets, and export the data in YOLOv8-compatible format, streamlining the process of preparing your own data for training.

8. **Training Guide:**
   ### Step-by-Step Guide: Training YOLOv8 on Custom Human Detection Dataset

   #### 1. Install Required Libraries
   ```python
   # Install the Ultralytics library using pip
   !pip install ultralytics

   # Install the Roboflow library using pip
   !pip install roboflow
   ```

   #### 2. Import Libraries
   ```python
   # Import the Roboflow and YOLO modules
   from roboflow import Roboflow
   from ultralytics import YOLO

   # The 'Roboflow' module is used for working with datasets on the Roboflow platform
   # The 'YOLO' module is imported from the 'ultralytics' library, which is used for YOLO object detection tasks
   ```

   #### 3. Set Up Roboflow Integration
   ```python
   # Import the Roboflow library and create an instance with the provided API key
   api_key = "your-api-key"
   rf = Roboflow(api_key)

   # Access the Roboflow workspace named "lazydevs"
   # Access the project named "human-detection" within the workspace
   workspace_name = "lazydevs"
   project_name = "human-detection"
   project = rf.workspace(workspace_name).project(project_name)
   ```

   #### 4. Download Dataset from Roboflow
   ```python
   # Download the dataset associated with version 4 of the project using YOLOv8 format
   # Note: You might want to include a specific version number or method for version selection.
   version = 4
   form = "yolov8"
   dataset = project.version(version).download(form)
   ```

   #### 5. Initialize YOLOv8 Model
   ```python
   # Initialize the YOLO model by loading the pre-trained weights from 'yolov8n.pt'
   model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
   ```

   #### 6. Train the Model
   ```python
   # Train the model with the specified parameters
   results = model.train(
       data='/kaggle/input/v4-yaml/data.yaml',  # Path to the training data YAML file
       epochs=150,  # Number of training epochs
       batch=64,  # Batch size for training
       imgsz=640,  # Input image size
       seed=32,  # Random seed for reproducibility
       optimizer='NAdam',  # Optimizer algorithm
       weight_decay=1e-4,  # Weight decay for regularization
       momentum=0.937,  # Initial momentum for the optimizer
       cos_lr=True,  # Use cosine learning rate scheduling
       lr0=0.01,  # Initial learning rate
       lrf=1e-5,  # Final learning rate
       warmup_epochs=10,  # Number of warmup epochs
       warmup_momentum=0.5,  # Momentum during warm-up epochs
       close_mosaic=20,  # Parameter for close mosaic augmentation
       label_smoothing=0.2,  # Label smoothing parameter for regularization
       dropout=0.5,  # Dropout rate to prevent overfitting
       verbose=True  # Print verbose training information
   )
   ```
